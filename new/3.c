// You are given a string S consisting of only small letters alphabet. The task is to make the string Palindrome by doing some specific tasks.
// In one operation you can delete a character from the string and rearrange the letter of the string however you want.
// Your task is to find out the minimum number of operations needed to make this string palindrome. It is guaranteed that you can always make the string Palindrome by doing a finite number of operations.
// Note: A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar.
// Input Format
// First line contains string S
// Constraints
// 1<= |S| <= 1000
// Output Format
// Print a single integer , minimum number of operations.
// Sample Input 0
// racecax
// Sample Output 0
// 2
// Sample Input 1
// abbax
// Sample Output 1
// 0
